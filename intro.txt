Node js is a run time environment to run js

when Ryan dan has taken the JS engine v8 and embeded in C++ and created an executable. 

then all the front end enginers where very happy, as now they can use JS itself at backend

so we can install node js
check version, npm as well

how to start node terminal: windows+R = cmd
node then press enter

as like normally we can use browser to run javascript.
we can run JS in node terminal

but it does not support few objects like
local storage API
document.getElementById()

----------------------------------------

Its a run time enviroment which runs on server

 we can run frameworks like Django,flask,php

we can run JS on server using node js
it runs on asynchronous - non blocking i/o model
// single thread can mange multiple connection
// as its non blocking i/o model


// run the file using node filename
// else run on repl



// when we run node js on server it can handle multiple connections

// npm init will create node modules will be ignored by github

//  npm i -g nodemon

//  if e change the new output reruns 

//  few dependencies we want to use in development

//  npm i --save-dev nodemon

// dev-dependency: nodemon


// dependency tree pacakage-Lock.json

// express needs more so what ever who install adds in pacakage.json
